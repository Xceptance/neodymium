# [DEF-20260916-01] Full-Page Visual Assertion Baseline Recorded As Viewport Capture During Multi-Turn Tool Loops

- **Status:** Resolved
- **Opened:** 2026-09-16
- **Closed:** 2026-09-16
- **Component:** `neodymium-core` (`ai-pipeline`)
- **Scope:** `Framework`
- **Symptom:** In `VerlaGuestCheckout_Pl_Polish_testCheckoutReplayPerfect`, step 19 (`Na środku ekranu znajduje się zielony znacznik wyboru (visual: full).`) failed during replay with SSIM 0.6878 against the recorded baseline (required >= 0.99), causing a `DivergenceException`.
- **Root Cause:**
  1. In `AgentToolLoopStep`, for visual assertions, `activeContextLevel` is `ContextLevel.VISUAL`, where `ContextLevel.isFullPageScreenshot()` evaluates to `false`. When an agent loop required multiple turns (e.g. recovering from an invalid tool call), subsequent turns refreshed page state using `executor.captureState(activeContextLevel, activeContextLevel.isFullPageScreenshot())`. This captured a 1500x857 viewport screenshot and overwrote `KEY_LAST_STATE`.
  2. In `VerifyOutcomeStep`, for steps without mutating DOM actions (`step.getActions().isEmpty()`), the pipeline previously discarded `KEY_POST_ACTION_STATE` (which had been freshly captured as full-page by `ExecuteActionsStep`) and fell back to `KEY_LAST_STATE` (overwritten with the viewport capture). It hashed that viewport capture while marking `step.setFullPage(true)`.
  3. During replay, `VisualBaselineGateStep` checked `step.isFullPageVisualStep()`, correctly captured a 1500x1122 full-page screenshot, and compared it against the recorded 1500x857 viewport hash, causing SSIM 0.6878 < 0.99 (`DivergenceException`).
- **Detection Gap ("What did we miss?"):**
  - Existing test `testVisualStepDoesNotConsumeStalePostActionState` in `VerifyOutcomeStepTest` specifically tested that viewport visual steps without actions discard `KEY_POST_ACTION_STATE` in favor of viewport `KEY_LAST_STATE`, but did not test full-page visual steps (`(visual: full)` or `step.isFullPageVisualStep()`).
  - Unit tests for `AgentToolLoopStep` did not verify the `isFullPage` flag passed to `captureState` during intermediate turns.
- **Resolution:**
  1. Updated `AgentToolLoopStep` lines 357, 1086, and 1195 so that initial, intermediate, and visual observation state captures evaluate `isFullPage` considering `(step != null && step.isFullPageVisualStep()) || Boolean.TRUE.equals(context.getTransientData().get("KEY_IS_FULL_PAGE_SCREENSHOT")) || activeContextLevel.isFullPageScreenshot()`.
  2. Updated `VerifyOutcomeStep` lines 116-124 to preserve and consume `KEY_POST_ACTION_STATE` whenever `isFullPageReq` is true, even when `step.getActions()` is empty.
- **Safety Net Added:**
  - Added unit test `testVisualStepWithFullPagePreservesPostActionState` in `VerifyOutcomeStepTest`.
  - Added unit test `testMultiTurnFullPageVisualStepPreservesFullPageCapture` in `AgentToolLoopStepTest`.
  - Added full-page capture tracking (`capturedFullPageFlags`) in `MockTargetExecutor`.
