# [DEF-20260916-03] PESAP Pipeline Decoupling & Direct Agent Execution Migration

- **Status:** Resolved
- **Opened:** 2026-09-16
- **Closed:** 2026-09-16
- **Component:** `neodymium-core` (`ai-pipeline`)
- **Scope:** `Framework`
- **Symptom:** Upfront PESAP (Pre-Execution Step Analysis & Partitioning) introduced mandatory out-of-band LLM calls prior to action execution, created architectural tight coupling with regex/language heuristics, and constrained instruction autonomy in `AgentToolLoopStep`.
- **Root Cause:** PESAP was originally designed as a speculative pre-classifier that partitioned steps and guessed context levels before seeing actual browser execution results. This architectural separation created redundancy with the agent tool loop and violated language neutrality by encouraging intent keyword sniffing and premature DOM exclusion hacks.
- **Detection Gap ("What did we miss?"):** Early AI test designs tested PESAP in isolation via `PesapPreStepTest`, rather than measuring end-to-end latency, multilingual robustness, and tool-loop adaptability without upfront classification overhead.
- **Resolution:**
  1. Decoupled `PesapPreStep` from `ExecuteActionsStep.mapPlaybookStepToPipelineStep()`, enabling direct tool loop execution for live recording steps.
  2. Deprecated `PesapPreStep`, `PesapPrompt`, and `isPesapEnabled()`, defaulting PESAP configuration to `false`.
  3. Streamlined `AgentToolLoopStep` Turn 1 SUT capture to universal `ContextLevel.LEAN` baseline and refined completion/verification prompt guidance.
- **Safety Net Added:** Comprehensive test suite execution across `AgentToolLoopStepTest` (38 tests) and `ExecuteActionsStepTest` (9 tests) ensuring direct agent autonomous execution succeeds without upfront PESAP calls.
